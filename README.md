Remote Chef with Ansible
========================

## Why Chef?

Chef is pretty cool for software engineers to be able 
to use for configuration management while still leveraging
their software engineering expertise.  Others like cfengine, 
puppet, SaltStack, and others may be capable tools -- but 
in my experience Chef has been the most effective and versatile 
tool for enforcing configuration on linux-based systems.

## Why Ansible?

Well, there are a lot of tools that could do the same thing.  

Ansible is just the one that I chose.
